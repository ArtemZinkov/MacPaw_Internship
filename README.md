Create a game catalog with an ability to add movie info with a title, poster, genre, year of production and description and the ability to view information about movie. It should be possible to search for a movie by the title, genre, year or any word from the description.

Optionally you may add a possibility to save all the data in any format you like to be able to restore it on the next app launch.
